# BackupTimer = At what time should a Backup be created? The format is: 'hh-mm' e.g. '12-30'.
# DeleteOldBackups = Deletes old backups automatically after a specific time (in days, standard = 7 days)
# DeleteOldBackups - Type '0' at DeleteOldBackups to disable the deletion of old backups.
# BackupLimiter = Deletes old backups automatically if number of total backups is greater than this number (e.g. if you enter '5' - the oldest backup will be deleted if there are more than 5 backups, so you will always keep the latest 5 backups)
# BackupLimiter - Type '0' to disable this feature. If you don't type '0' the feature 'DeleteOldBackups' will be disabled and this feature ('BackupLimiter') will be enabled.
